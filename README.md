This repository contains solutions for R Language Lab Assignment 1, covering the fundamentals of R programming and basic data analysis tasks.
All exercises are implemented as part of the R Programming Lab coursework in Computer Science (AI & DS specialization).

üìÇ Repository Structure

1.Each exercise is implemented in a separate R script.

2.Files are organized according to lab sections (Variables, Operators, Loops, Conditionals, Functions, and Data Analysis).

3.Includes code and outputs (where applicable).
